Coders For Causes Task as preparation for 2023 Winter Projects
Will do further modifications of this web-app on my personal profile from now on (instead of within CodersForLearning)

## Basic requirements for this todo app:
- Ability to create a new task (Done!!)
- Ability to mark a task as completed (Done!! Though not too clear - something to improve on as a personal project?)
- Ability to delete a task (Done!!)

## Adding extra flair:
- Font (learnt about font-family!)

## Extra features:
- Wipe out the whole list
- List saves itself through local storage

## Something to work on:
- Editing the list items
- 'Pending' and 'Completed' sections
- Dates (Due dates and completed dates)
